## Introduction
Hello, my name is Khang Vo Huynh and I am a junior international student from Viet Nam. I am currently a student at St. Olaf College majoring in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in statistics and data science. My research interest areas include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Applied Mathematics. At the same time, I am also in love with the application of these fields.
