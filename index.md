## Introduction
Hello, my name is Khang Vo Huynh and I am a junior international student from Viet Nam. I am currently a student at St. Olaf College majoring in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in statistics and data science. My research interest areas include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Applied Mathematics. At the same time, I am also in love with the application of these fields.

## Research Experience
I have contributed to five different research project and one industrial project. Below are the information about these projects

*Finding Keys to the Peano Curve*\
Paul D. Humke, **Khang V. Huynh** \

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
The purpose of this paper is to give a fairly complete analysis of Peanoâ€™s space filling curve. We begin with a synopsis of the history of the curve, but then begin an analysis using the geometric methods that Hilbert developed. We show that this inherent geometry can be viewed as governed by the action of the Klein Four Group and continue to give a rather full arithmetization of the Peano Curve.
