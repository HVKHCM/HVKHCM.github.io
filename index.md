# Introduction
Hello, my name is Khang Vo Huynh and I am a junior international student from Viet Nam. I am currently a student at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) majoring in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in statistics and data science. In the past, I have contributed to research projects in multiple different fields at my home institution, including pure mathematics (result in a publication and possibly a second one), system/networking and cloud computing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. My starting point was a student who was enthusiastic in pure mathematics but then leaning toward artificial intelligence and robotics research areas because I realize the potential and the use of these research.

My current research interest area is a combination of mathematics, artificial intelligence and robotics and my goal is to earn a PhD in computer science, specialize in one of these areas or an intersection of them all. I want to design algorithm that enables intelligent system and robots to be capable of solving real-world problems.
