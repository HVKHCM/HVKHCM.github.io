# Welcome to my page
Hello, my name is Khang Vo Huynh and I am a junior international student from Viet Nam. I am currently a student at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) majoring in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in statistics and data science. In the past, I have contributed to research projects in multiple different fields at my home institution, including pure mathematics (result in a publication and possibly a second one), system/networking and cloud computing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. My starting point was a student who is enthusiastic in pure mathematics but then leaning toward artificial intelligence and robotics research areas because I realize the potential and the use of these research.

My current research interest areas is a combination of mathematics, artificial intelligence and robotics and my goal is to earn a PhD in computer science, specialize in one of these areas or an intersection of them all.

Here are some additional documents: [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNBnl8Yg-nTZJ7d_OFaOqXjK8qzWjeaV/view?usp=sharing) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khang-huynh-353242208/)
