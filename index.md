## Introduction
Hello, my name is Khang Vo Huynh and I am a junior international student from Viet Nam. I am currently a student at St. Olaf College majoring in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in statistics and data science. My research interest areas include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Applied Mathematics. At the same time, I am also in love with the application of these fields.

Here are some additional documents: [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNBnl8Yg-nTZJ7d_OFaOqXjK8qzWjeaV/view?usp=sharing) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khang-huynh-353242208/)
