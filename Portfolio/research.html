          ABSTRACT <br>
          The purpose of this paper is to give a fairly complete analysis of Peano's space filling curve. We begin with a synopsis of the history of 
the curve, but then begin an analysis using the geometric methods that Hilbert developed.  We show that this inherent geometry can be viewed 
as governed by the action of the Klein Four Group and continue to give a rather full arithmetization of the Peano Curve. <br>

        ABSTRACT <br> 
        In this paper we are concerned with space-filling curves that map a
        linear perfect set onto a closed domain in R<sup>n</sup>. Specifically we prove that
        there is a space-filling curve, f : [0, 1] → [0, 1]<sup>n</sup>
        that is at most (n+1)-to-1 at every point. We include a rather simple proof that every such space
        filling curve is at least n+1-to-1 at infinitely many points. This latter result is corollary to a more general theorem of Hurewicz and is related
        to, but seemingly independent of the Lebesgue Covering Theorem.

              ABSTRACT <br> 
              This project will build on work in which robot teams explored a single floor of an indoor environment and extend this to multi-floor environments and outdoor environments, where multiple sources of communication interference arise. In the multi-level environment, the physical barrier of the floor/ceiling introduces some significant interference, that varies from building to building. Outdoors, the surrounding signal coverage is different, and the topology of the environment (ditches, hills, fences/barriers) can have unexpected impacts on communication availability. This project’s primary research objectives are to identify interference sources and adapt existing algorithms to handle changing communication availability. This objective will be accomplished by implementing the current algorithms on different types of robots, running experiments to identify and measure the interference that occurs, and then developing techniques for the robots to identify and adapt to interference when it occurs.

          ABSTRACT <br>
          Runestone textbook is written for beginning programmers who want to explore the concept of PDC. The ActiveCode, a feature of Runestone, provides learners a chance to interact with their own PDC code by compiling and analyzing the result. Kubernetes and Docker are the key technologies to provide the portability, extensibility, sustainability, and management of Runestone’s backend. By receiving the request from the user through ActiveCode, we then send these requests to the backend where pods are ready to process the compilation. We then send back the result to the Runestone website interface for the user to analyze the result of their own code. Our service includes MPI and OpenMP requests. By containerizing the whole process using Kubernetes and Docker, we can modify the Docker images, the template file, etc. to different needs. Our future plan is to provide more containers for mpi4py, CUDA and other PDC computations.

          ABSTRACT <br>
          The Raspberry Pi single-board hardware architecture provides a  low-cost,  robust  platform  for  learning  high-performance computing.  We  have  improved  and  extended  the  Self Organizing Cluster (SOC) system we demonstrated in 2020, in order  to  make  learning  about  cluster  computing  more convenient and accessible at St. Olaf and elsewhere.
          The SOC consists of Raspberry Pi units and other commodity hardware components and standard Linux-based open-source software  (i.e.,  a  Beowulf  cluster),  and  is  designed  for automated  cluster  configuration,  making  it  possible  for beginners to conveniently setup, learn from, and tear down a cluster within a single class period.

            ABSTRACT <br> 
            The Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIR) brought together undergraduate statistics students supervised by statistics faculty with faculty and students from other disciplines to share in the excitement and challenge of working across the traditional academic boundaries to collaborate on research.  Under our current grant, the CIR will be expanded to include applied and computational mathematics and an increased number of students from underrepresented groups, while still maintaining the original grant’s goals of attracting more students to graduate study and careers in the mathematical sciences, especially through successful interdisciplinary, collaborative research experiences as undergraduates.
